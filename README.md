# MXC (MX-control)
Control panel for hosted email with DirectAdmin.

This project is meant to provide a clean, easy interface for providers wanting to offer hosted email services with DirectAdmin as its backend. Here's what it will do eventually:

- Link a DirectAdmin user to MXC and allow the user to use MXC to manage their email addresses, etc
- Provide simplified instructions to users for DNS setup including DKIM management
- Allow for the management of email addresses, aliases, vacation messages
- Allow for the management of user domains (add-on domains, but users will be unable to modify their primary domain)
- Full quota compatibility with DirectAdmin
- Allow for one-click access to email inboxes
- Full whitelabelling support and easy template modification for customization

Here's what it won't do:
- Absolve you of the responsibility of paying for a DirectAdmin license
- Any hand-holding. Basic support will be provided, but don't expect me to answer any issues at 3 o'clock in the morning. In other words, don't be an d-ck and I'll be happy to help.

This project does have a Trello board for task management: https://trello.com/b/PUd3mQKr/mxc

You're free to leave comments & suggestions there in the appropriate card; I appreciate all feedback so if you have anythiing to say, please tell me! In addition, I will take into account any feature requests and will implement them on a case-by-case basis.

There's currently no timeline for an alpha release, but I expect to have a testable version of this ready by the end of May (I am quite busy and am developing this on the side).
